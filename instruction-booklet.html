								<p>EEO-1 reporting is an electronic, online application. The EEOC requires that EEO-1 reports be submitted via the EEO-1 Online Filing System. Data can be entered directly into the online application or submitted as an electronically transmitted data file.</p>
								<p>Any employer who claims that the electronic submission of Standard Form 100 would create undue hardship may apply to the Commission for a special reporting procedure in accordance with the instructions set forth in paragraph 5.</p>
								<p class="card-ques"><b>1.2.2 Single-establishment employers,</b></p>
								<p>i.e., employers doing business at only one establishment in one location must complete a single EEO-1 online data record.</p>
								<p class="card-ques"><b>1.2.3 Multi-establishment employers,</b></p>
								<p>i.e., employers doing business at more than one establishment must complete online: (1) a report covering the principal or headquarters office; (2) a separate report for each establishment employing 50 or more persons; and (3) a separate report (Type 8 report) for each establishment employing fewer than 50 employees, OR an “Establishment List” (Type 6 report), showing the name, address, and total employment for each establishment employing fewer than 50 persons. For the EEO-1 online portal, companies using “Establishment” List reports (Type 6), must enter all employment data into the “Consolidated” report (Type 2). For the EEO-1 online application, all keyed employment data including data from the Type 8 “Establishment” reports will automatically transfer to populate the overall Consolidated Report.</p>
								<p>The total number of employees indicated on the headquarters report, PLUS the establishment reports, PLUS the list of establishments employing fewer than 50 employees, MUST equal the total number of employees shown on the Consolidated Report. Employment data for multi-establishment companies, including parent corporations and their subsidiary holdings, must report all employees working at each company establishment or subsidiary establishment. For purposes of this report, the term parent corporation refers to any corporation which owns all or the majority stock of another corporation so that the latter relates to it as a subsidiary.</p>

Any EEOC employee who violates this prohibition may be found guilty of a criminal misdemeanor and could be fined or imprisoned. The confidentiality requirements allow the EEOC to publish only aggregated data, and only in a manner that does not reveal any particular filer’s or any individual employee’s personal information.</p>
								<p>OFCCP will notify contractors of any Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests that are made to obtain any of the data provided on the EEO-1 report and will protect the confidentiality of EEO-1 data to the maximum extent possible consistent with FOIA and the Trade Secrets Act. However, should OFCCP receive FOIA requests for any EEO-1 data on filers not within its jurisdiction, OFCCP will refer the requests to the EEOC for a response. The confidentiality provision of Section 709(e) of Title VII applies to all EEO-1 data submitted by filers that are not federal contractors, and the EEOC adheres to that statutory provision when reviewing all requests for EEO-1 data.</p>

To assist you in determining where to place your jobs within the job categories, a description of them is in the EEO-1 Job Classification Guide <a target="_blank" class="blueColor" href="https://www.eeoc.gov/employers/eeo1survey/jobclassguide.cfm">(https://www.eeoc.gov/employers/eeo1survey/jobclassguide.cfm)</a> or you may consult the EEO-1 Census Codes Crosswalk web site <a target="_blank" class="blueColor" href="https://www.census.gov/topics/employment/industry-occupation/guidance/code-lists.html">(https://www.census.gov/topics/employment/industry-occupation/guidance/code-lists.html)</a>.

				<h2 class="text-center medium mt-3 mb-3" id="race">Race Ethnicity, and Sex Identification</h2>
				<p>Self-identification is the preferred method of identifying the race and ethnicity information necessary for the EEO-1 report. Employers are required to attempt to allow employees to use self-identification to complete the EEO-1 report. As to the method of collecting data, the basic principles for ethnic and racial self- identification for purposes of the EEO-1 report are: (1) Offer employees the opportunity to self-identify (2) Provide a statement about the voluntary nature of this inquiry for employees. For example, language such as the following may be used (employers may adapt this language): “The employer is subject to certain governmental recordkeeping and reporting requirements for the administration of civil rights laws and regulations. In order to comply with these laws, the employer invites employees to voluntarily self-identify their race or ethnicity. Submission of this information is voluntary and refusal to provide it will not subject you to any adverse treatment. The information obtained will be kept confidential and may only be used in accordance with the provisions of applicable laws, executive orders, and regulations, including those that require the information to be summarized and reported to the federal government for civil rights enforcement. When reported, data will not identify any specific individual.” If an employee declines to self-identify his or her race and/or ethnicity, employment records or observer identification may be used. Where records are maintained, it is recommended that they be kept separately from the employee’s basic personnel file or other records available to those responsible for personnel decisions. Race and ethnicity designations as used by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for the EEO-1 do not denote scientific definitions of anthropological origins. In addition, such designations do not control who is protected by Title VII’s prohibitions against employment discrimination based on race or national origin.</p>

				<p>The major job categories are listed below, including a brief description of the skills and training required for occupations in that category and examples of the job titles that fit each category. The examples shown below are illustrative and not intended to be exhaustive of all job titles in a job category. These job categories are primarily based on the average skill level, knowledge, and responsibility involved in each occupation within the job category. The “Officials and Managers” category as a whole is to be divided into the following two subcategories: “Executive/Senior Level Officials and Managers,” and “First/Mid-Level” Officials and Managers.” These subcategories are intended to mirror the employers own well established hierarchy of management positions. Small employers who may not have two well-defined hierarchical steps of management should report their management employees in the appropriate categories.</p>

								<p>Individuals who plan, direct and formulate policies, set strategy and provide the overall direction of enterprises/organizations for the development and delivery of products or services, within the parameters approved by boards of directors or other governing bodies. Residing in the highest levels of organizations, these executives plan, direct or coordinate activities with the support of subordinate executives and staff managers. They include, in larger organizations, those individuals within two reporting levels of the CEO, whose responsibilities require frequent interaction with the CEO. Examples of these kinds of managers are: chief executive officers, chief operating officers, chief financial officers, line of business heads, presidents or executive vice presidents of functional areas or operating groups, chief information officers, chief human resources officers, chief marketing officers, chief legal officers, management directors and managing partners.</p>

								<p>Individuals who serve as managers, other than those who serve as Executive/Senior Level Officials and Managers, including those who oversee and direct the delivery of products, services or functions at group, regional or divisional levels of organizations. These managers receive directions from the Executive/Senior Level management and typically lead major business units. They implement policies, programs and directives of executive/senior management through subordinate managers and within the parameters set by Executive/Senior Level management. Examples of these kinds of managers are: vice presidents and directors, group, regional or divisional controllers; treasurers; human resources, information systems, marketing, and operations managers. The “First/Mid-Level Officials and Managers” subcategory also includes those who report directly to middle managers. These individuals serve at functional, line of business segment or branch levels and are responsible for directing and executing the day-to-day operational objectives of enterprises/organizations, conveying the directions of higher level officials and managers to subordinate personnel and, in some instances, directly supervising the activities of exempt and non-exempt personnel. Examples of these kinds of managers are: first-line managers; team managers; unit managers; operations and production mangers; branch managers; administrative services managers; purchasing and transportation managers; storage and distribution managers; call center or customer service managers; technical support managers; and brand or product managers.</p>
